## Introduction
  In this assignment, we used Java programming language to develop a program which is Electricity Billing System. We have learned user defined classes, exception handling, graphical user interface (GUI), file processing and array list of object. Besides that, we used these concepts to develop this program.

  We created four GUIs in this system. On Main Menu, there are three function of buttons. First button - Add Data. When user click the button, it will go into Add Data page. Second button - Records. It displays all the records that have been saved into file. Third button - Exit. When user click the button, it will exit the system.

  On Add Data page, we can see a table of electricity billing system. Then, user should insert all the textfield that had provided. There are three function of buttons in the Add Data page. First button - Save. When user click the button, data will be saved if all the textfield have been filled, otherwise show an error message. Second button – Reset. When user click the button, all the textfield will reset. Third button – Back. When user click the button, it will back to Menu page.

  On Records page, we can see all the information that key in before in the form of table. Besides that, user can search the data by account number or by name. There are five buttons in the Records page. First button – Search. When user click the button, user can search the data. Second button – Reset. When user click the button, it will reset to show all the records. Third button – Edit. When user click the button, user should search the account number or name first, then will go into Edit Data page. Forth button – Delete. When user click the button, user should search the account number or name first, then user can delete the records. Fifth button – Back. When user click the button, it will back to Menu page.

  On Edit Data page, we can see a table of electricity billing system. Moreover, user can edit the data at textfield. There are three buttons in Edit Data page. First button – Edit Data. When user click the button, the edited data will be saved if the textfield have been filled. Second button – Reset. When user click the button, all the textfield will reset. Third button – Back. When user click the button, will back to Menu page.

  In conclusion, we enjoy developing this Electricity Billing System. We have learned a lot of new things in this group project. So, we created this program is purposely for counting the electricity billing of customers.
